-- This file was automatically generated by GoAhead

-- Normally, there is no need for modifying this file.
-- However, there are comments with the keywords "architecture_declaration" 
-- and "architecture_body" that easily allow adding extra code to this file
-- Example for adding "internal_signal_a <= internal_signal_b" to the body of your_file.vhd:
-- cat your_file.vhd | sed 's/-- architecture_body/internal_signal_a := internal_signal_b;/g' | tr ":" "<" > out.vhd
-- Note that we use ":=" instead of "<=", which is corrected by tr (translate)
